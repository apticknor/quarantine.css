User Content
============

Overview
-------------

User content is a quarantine class used in front-end development when unknown content is going to be injected into a container (most likely via CMS or a WYSIWYG). It allows for the flexibility of keeping predefined styles when the content being included is unknown.

Usage
-------------
* grab the styles you want out of the user-content.css file and include them on your project
* update the styles to work with your website
* wrap user content in an HTML element with the class "user-content"
* watch the magic happen

```<div class="user-content"> <!-- unknown html goes here --> </div>```
